        BYPASS DISCORD AUTOMOD WITH THESE EASY STEPS.</h1>

        SO, Discord automod is something that all users love, right? However! Our teams have reverse-engineered many ways to bypass Discord automod, and we will go through them all and give you our personal findings.


    <br><br><br><p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">1: Using cyrillic characters. This usually works however doesn't work when the moderators of a Discord server has specifically put up blockings
    for those characters. This works 70% of the time. However, after a bunch of Discord scraping we have found that Discord servers mainly block those characters.
<br>
Additionally, they don't work as a "seamless" way to bypass, since Discord's new font style breaks those characters from looking exactly the same as Discords. Overall this is an 6/10.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">2: OUR FINDINGS.
<br> This is a great way to bypass all Automods, and it consists of 2 things: Spoilers, and embeddings.
<br><br> We have found out that using a special left-to-right embedding character, we can completely make a fully functioning spoiler invisible to the human eye. Meaning, no
black bars or nothing. Combining this with the fact that you can add words like the hard-r, f words, etc in between it can make it even better for bypassing. Here's an example.
