# My Portfolio!

This is a basic HTML portfolio project that consists of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It is not the greatest looking or the most optimized however it gets the job done which is to serve as a place to store all my projects, contact info, and etc..

## What's in this project?

← Navigation headers. Use the navigation buttons at the top to get to the designated spot quicker.

← User counter. This will go up everytime a user accesses the site.

← Scam prevention tips. This will teach you how to spot, decode, and securely report a scam going on.

← Public polls that users from anywhere around the world can interact and vote on a new update on the portfolio.

← Works page. This shows all of my projects that I've worked on.
← About me. This will also consist of my skills.

← And my contact info.

There's also hidden easter eggs, such as an iPhone simulator, but as for easter eggs we are not disclosing them. Any disclosing of EE locations will result in them being moved and links will be moved aswell.
